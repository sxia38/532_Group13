\subsection{Non-negative Matrix Factorization} 
In this section, we will briefly introduce the non-negative matrix factorization problem and algorithms in solving this problem. 
\subsubsection{Non-negative Matrix Factorization Problem}
The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF for short) problem can be expressed formally as the following: 
\begin{quotation}
	\noindent \textbf{NMF problem:} Given a non-negative matrix $A\in R^{m\times n}$ and a positive integer $k < min{m, n}$, find non-negative matrices $W \in R^{m\times k}$ and $H \in R^{k \times n}$ to minimize the cost function
	\begin{equation}
	f(W, H) = \frac{1}{2}\|A-WH\|_F^2
	\end{equation} 
\end{quotation} 

The product $WH$ is called a non-negative matrix factorization of $A$. Through NMF, we get a low-rank (at most rank $k$) approximation, $WH$, of the original matrix $A$. 

There are two note-worthy properties about NMF that we would like to mention at this moment. First is that, NMF can be written column by column as
\begin{equation}
a_i = Wh_i, \;\; i \in {1, 2, ..., n}
\end{equation}

Where $a_i$ is the i-th column vector of matrix $A$, and $h_i$ is the corresponding column vector of matrix $H$. That is to say, each data vector $a_i$ is approximated by a linear combination of the columns of $W$, weighted by the components of $h_i$. Therefore, $W$ can be regarded as a basis that is optimized for the linear approximation of data $A$. Usually, the parameter $k$ is small compare to the dimension of $A$, so NMF will be a good approximation if there exists latent structures in vectors of data matrix $A$. 

Second property of NMF is that, negative entries are not allowed in $W$ and $H$. For this reason, NMF is intuitively a part-based representation, since the whole is formed by combining the parts. These two features make NMF a good method for text classification, we will discuss this with details in later sections. 
\subsubsection{Basic Algorithms for Solving NMF Problems}
Though NMF problems has a simple form, it has been proven that finding the exact solution of these problems in general is NP-hard.
